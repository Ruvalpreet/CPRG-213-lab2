                <li>Bring a boil a large pot of salted water and cook the rice for about 5 to 8 minutes or until it
                    still has a bite to it, al dente. Do not let it go soft. Drain and set aside.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, in a large skillet melt and warm up the 2 tablespoons olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter.
                    Add the onion and gently cook them until translucent. Add the cranberries, almonds, dates. Season with salt
                    and pepper. Stir into all the ingredients are well incorporated.</li>
                <li>COOKING & ASSEMBLING THE DISH</li>
                <li>In a shallow round pan with a fitting lid, place 1 tablespoon olive oil and 2 tablespoon butter. Add
                    half of the cooked rice and spread it to cover the bottom of the pan. Add the onion mixture to form a layer.
                    Cover the mixture with the remainder of the rice. Spread the saffron with the water all over it. Add ¼ cup
                    more water to the pan. Add the remaining oil and butter on top of the rice. Place over medium-high heat
                    covered and making sure that all the steam stays inside. Place a towel between the pan and the lid. Let it

                    side down first and sauté until the skin is super crispy (It will look burned as it is normal because of
                    the honey).</li>
